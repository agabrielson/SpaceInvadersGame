## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to **introduce children and beginners to programming** in a fun and interactive way. By engaging with a familiar game like Space Invaders, learners can explore coding concepts while seeing immediate, visual results.

**Key aspects of the purpose:**

- **Learning through play:**  
  Players can experiment with the code, adjusting values, graphics, and game logic to see how changes affect gameplay.

- **Well-documented code:**  
  Each class, function, and key variable includes comments and doxygen to illustrate Python fundamentals, such as loops, conditionals, object-oriented design, and event handling.

- **Cheat codes and modding:**  
  Built-in cheat codes encourage exploration, allowing learners to modify the game and see results instantly.

- **Problem-solving:**  
  Challenges like surviving waves or shooting aliens can be tied to coding exercises, such as adjusting difficulty, bullet speed, or alien behavior.

- **Gateway to programming:**  
  A stepping stone to advanced topics like graphical programming, Python libraries (PyQt), and eventually AI.

**In short:** This game is a hands-on learning tool designed to spark curiosity, teach coding fundamentals, and empower children to take their first steps into programming.
